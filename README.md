## Introduction

During my internship at Micro IIT, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of Python-based projects that helped me strengthen my programming fundamentals, improve my problem-solving abilities, and gain practical experience in developing user-friendly applications. The projects ranged from basic programming exercises to more advanced projects, each contributing to my growth as a Python developer.

## Tasks and Projects Overview

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the tasks and projects I completed during my internship:

- Project 1: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game ‚úÇÔ∏è

Description: A classic game where players compete against the computer by choosing rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined based on the rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.

Folder: Project 1 - Rock-Paper-Scissors.py

- Project 2: Calculator üßÆ
  
Description: A simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a user-friendly interface for inputting numbers and displaying results in real-time.

Folder: Project 2 -¬† Calculator.py

- Project 3: Password Generator üîê

Description: A secure tool that creates strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria like length and character types. It helps protect user accounts by generating complex and hard-to-guess passwords.

Folder: Project 3 - PasswordGenerator.py

Project 4:  Number Guessing Game üî¢

Description:An interactive game where the player guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range. It provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct, adding an element of challenge.
 
Folder: Project 4 -  NumberGuessingGame.py

- Project 5: Tic-Tac-Toe Game ‚ùå‚≠ï
  
Description: A classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking squares with X or O, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends with a win or a draw.

Folder: Project 5 - Tic-Tac-Toe Game.py

- Project 6: To-Do List üìù
  
Description: A task management tool that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. It helps enhance productivity and time management by organizing tasks efficiently.

Folder: Project 6 - To-Do-List.py
